Task:
Given some pairs of student ID and mark, sort them by their marks in descending
order and in case of tie sort them by ascending order of their ID. Also find
the minimum number of swaps necessary to sort them in the mentioned way.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by three lines. First line contains N, the number of
pairs. Second line contains a list of distinct integers A[i] representing the
student IDs. Third line contains another list of integers B[i] representing the
marks. The pairs are (A[i], B[i]).

Output:
For each test in the given order, print the minimum number of necessary swaps
in the first line and then the sorted pairs in N more lines. See sample output
for more exact detail.

Example-1 (batch-1):
Input (stdin):
1
7
7 4 9 3 2 5 1
40 50 50 20 10 10 10
Output (stdout):
Minimum swaps: 4
ID: 4 Mark: 50
ID: 9 Mark: 50
ID: 7 Mark: 40
ID: 3 Mark: 20
ID: 1 Mark: 10
ID: 2 Mark: 10
ID: 5 Mark: 10

Example-2 (batch-2):
Input (stdin):
2
4
7 2 5 3
80 60 80 50
1
1
1
Output (stdout):
Minimum swaps: 2
ID: 5 Mark: 80
ID: 7 Mark: 80
ID: 2 Mark: 60
ID: 3 Mark: 50
Minimum swaps: 0
ID: 1 Mark: 1

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 2s (java) or 2s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
